									"Sam is by far the best TA I have had this semester. Is almost always available to give help and responds to questions very quickly."
									<br>
									- Calculus I Student
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									"I can't think of anything that Sam could improve on. He is kind to all students and tries his hardest to help everyone understand calculus. There is nothing he could improve on, and any attempt to imply that he can improve is complete blasphemy." 
									<br>
									- Calculus I Student
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									"SAM IS A GREAT TA!!! PUTS A TON OF WORK IN."
									<br>
									- Calculus I Student
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>
									"There is nothing Sam can improve upon, and the very notion of it would be an affront to God. In all seriousness he was my favorite instructor this semester and I don't have any complaints at all."

										"Sam's abailabilty and willingness to help has been top notch. Give this man a raise and make him head of the department."
										<br>
										- Calculus II Student
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										"Sam has been a great TA. He is devoted to his students' success. He answers questions promptly and has great office hours. He is always willing to help and is very knowledgeable about the math that he teaches. I have shown up to every recitation, and I believe that showing up consistently and his help have contributed greatly to my progress with the class."
										<br>
										- Calculus II Student
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										"Sam breaks down the material in a way that actually makes sense. He doesn't just assume we know everything, and welcomes questions without making me feel stupid."
										<br>
										- Calculus II Student
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										"Sam was able to explain all of the concepts that we were learning in a way that made sense to me. He was also very good at making the recitation feel less like a chore by playing music in the background and talking to us as people rather than as students. Sam was the only reason I was able to succeed in this course, because I didn't absorb any information in the lectures, but he was able to help in a way that solidified the information in my head. He was also very flexible with office hours, but I wasn't able to take advantage of many of them because of overlap with my other classes."
										<br>
										- Calculus II Student
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										"Sam is consistently available and willing to help. He celebrates every success and is driven and motivated to ensure every student understands the concepts and feels welcome. I couldn't ask for a better TA."
										<br>
										- Calculus II Student
									</p>
								</li>
								<li>
									<p>
										"Sam. 
										Just the way he teaches is phenomenal. He is definitely one of the best math TA’s and just in general teachers I’ve had. He is almost always available to help with questions and is very good at getting back to emails. And just the fact that he truly does show that he wants us to learn and to succeed."
