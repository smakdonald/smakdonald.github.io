									<tr> <td>13</td> 	<td>Spring 2022</td><td>Calculus II</td>			<td>Sam was able to explain all of the concepts that we were learning in a way that made sense to me. He was also very good at making the recitation feel less like a chore by playing music in the background and talking to us as people rather than as students. <b>Sam was the only reason I was able to succeed in this course</b>, because I didn't absorb any information in the lectures, but he was able to help in a way that solidified the information in my head.</td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>12</td> 	<td>Spring 2022</td><td>Calculus II</td>			<td>Sam breaks down the material in a way that actually makes sense. He doesn't just assume we know everything, and <b>welcomes questions without making me feel stupid.</b></td> </tr>

									<tr> <td>10</td> 	<td>Spring 2022</td><td>Calculus II</td>			<td>I truly attribute my success in Calc 1 and 2 to you and the caring help you provide. Based on my experience with other classes so far it is difficult to find another GTA who cares as much about his students success and well being as much as you do. You are very relatable and always find a way to lighten the mood. Your study sessions are very helpful and I looked forward to them both semesters. I am upset that I won't be able to take you for Calc 3. Every one of your students was lucky to have you, I was lucky to have you. Thank you for all of your hard work and dedication to us.</b></td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>9</td> 	<td>Spring 2022</td><td>Calculus II</td>			<td>You are an awesome instructor! My experience with math instructors has generally been middling to bad, so it was very refreshing to have an instructor that is actually good lol</b></td> </tr>

									<tr> <td>7</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>Thank you so much for going above and beyond with the office hours this semester. I know you aren't required to be as available as you were, and you don't need to be so available, but I know that it helped me a ton.</td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>6</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>You're going to be the teacher all the students love. Immaculate vibes smacdiddy</td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>5</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>I think you did an amazing job helping and making sure everyone understood the material we covered this year. I really appreciated the communication that you had with your students because not a lot of professors or other TAs communicate well. My advice is to keep that up.</td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>4</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>You're really good at teaching in a way we would understand, so keep doing that. Also, I appreciate how you would make mistakes, whether intentional or not; reminds me that math can be hard for anyone and everyone is still human. Unless you're actually an alien, then that'd be pretty cool</td> </tr>

									<tr> <td>2</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>I can't think of anything that Sam could improve on. He is kind to all students and <b>tries his hardest to help everyone understand calculus</b>. There is nothing he could improve on, and any attempt to imply that he can improve is complete blasphemy.</td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>1</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>Sam is by far the best TA I have had this semester. Is almost always available to give help and <b>responds to questions very quickly.</b></td> </tr>
									<tr> <td>0</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>There is nothing Sam can improve upon, and the very notion of it would be an affront to God. In all seriousness he was <b>my favorite instructor this semester</b> and I don't have any complaints at all.</td> </tr>
