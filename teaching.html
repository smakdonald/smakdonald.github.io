Based on my experience with other classes so far it is difficult to find another GTA who cares as much about his students success and well being as much as you do. You are very relatable and always find a way to lighten the mood. Your study sessions are very helpful and I looked forward to them both semesters.

									<tr> <td>5</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>I think you did an amazing job helping and making sure everyone understood the material we covered this year.

									<tr> <td>4</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>You're really good at teaching in a way we would understand, so keep doing that. Also, I appreciate how you would make mistakes, whether intentional or not; reminds me that math can be hard for anyone and everyone is still human.

									<tr> <td>2</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>I can't think of anything that Sam could improve on. He is kind to all students and <b>tries his hardest to help everyone understand calculus</b>. There is nothing he could improve on, and any attempt to imply that he can improve is complete blasphemy.</td> </tr>

									<tr> <td>0</td> 	<td>Fall 2021</td>	<td>Calculus I</td>				<td>There is nothing Sam can improve upon, and the very notion of it would be an affront to God. In all seriousness he was <b>my favorite instructor this semester</b> and I don't have any complaints at all.</td> </tr>
